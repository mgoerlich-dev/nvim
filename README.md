This is MY vim config, so it's tightly coupled to my needs and my personal
workflow. I wouldn't recommend using it like it is, since you probably have a
different workflow and/or different requirements.<sup id="footnote-str">[*](#str-footnote)</sup>
But you're dearly invited to read through it, pick what you like and use it to
assemble your own vimrc.

If you find an inefficency or any other flaw about how I configured something
don't hestitate to tell me, I'm always open for constructive criticism.

P.S.: This vimrc actually is exclusively for usage with neovim, since I use it
on all my systems. It's not tested with any other Vim derivates.

<sup id="footnote">[*](#footnote-str)</sup>If you disagree, don't let me stop
you. But don't expect me to give you support on this. :)
